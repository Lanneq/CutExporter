This add-on will help you design cabinet furniture (and not only) in a blender and in 1 click receive a full cut of all parts and take into account the position of textures on the parts. This is an assistant that saves mountains of time for designers and manufacturers who choose blender as the main editor of the 3D editor when designing cabinet products.

The addon works in conjunction with other programs that have limitations in the free version. In particular, Astra R-Nesting in the free version has an introductory mark on the page when printing a cut. The paid version allows you to send cutting to CNC machines. <br> 
Opticutter in the free version is limited to the number of parts of 20 different panels.

When choosing a cutting program, leave your preference for astra. Since it has a much greater advantage over the opticutter due to the ability to work, including with machines and generate a complete report on parts.
